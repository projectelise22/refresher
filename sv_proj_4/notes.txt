TB components and TB module created to test connection within components
-> using an interface
-> sending stimulus via transactions
-> sharing created transactions using mailboxes
-> connecting dut to tb components
-> files will not work in verilator, it does not support classes, and interfaces,
-> TB simulated using VivadoS
-> random stimulus has no specific scenario, again only to test the connection between tb classes
